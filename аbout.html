          Cobble Hill was founded in 2005 with a desire to bring quality puzzles
          manufactured in North America that inspire a loving, whimsical,
          nostalgic feeling to jigsaw puzzle enthusiasts, and novices.

          The company's signature feature has always been its random cut die and
          quirky piece shapes. It's also recognizable by its linen print texture
          not only on the puzzle, but on the box as well. Made with high quality
          blue board using recyclable materials, the puzzles have always been
          made with the environment in mind.
